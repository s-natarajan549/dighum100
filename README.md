I. Project Introduction:
Climate change and environmental issues have gained much more attention from the public over the last several decades. For this project, I wanted to explore how climate change information is expressed and received from various news outlets.

II. Research Questions:
What topics and questions are most frequently being discussed in major news sources regarding climate change?
What sentiments do the media have towards this issue?
How much are different countries discussing climate change in their media relative to the United States?
III. Datasets and Tools:
Global Warming News Articles from A Dataset for Information Spreading over the News by Abdul Sittar, Dunja Mladenic, and Tomaz Erjavec.
