Research Questions:

What topics and questions are most frequently being discussed in major news sources regarding climate change?
What sentiments do the media have towards this issue?
And how is the public responding?
Methods Used: Overview Docs - create word cloud and plot to visualize word and theme frequency among articles. (in progress!)

Dataset: Currently imported - Global Warming News Articles from A Dataset for Information Spreading over the News by Abdul Sittar, Dunja Mladenic, and Tomaz Erjavec. Currently uploaded is the spreadsheet with titles, which I will do a sentiment analysis on eventually.
