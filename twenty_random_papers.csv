1,"Insect pests- such as maize stemborers and fall armyworm- increasingly challenge food production around the world.--Huge demands for crops have meant agricultural systems have simplified and frequently focused on single crops. When fields are full of a single crop they can easily be found by their insect pests- as opposed to when the crop is mixed in with others. Because of this higher yield losses have more chance to occur.--Climate change - mostly increased temperatures and changes in rainfall patterns - and wild habitat reduction by farmers has added to this by increasing pest pressure and resurgence.--The rapid evolution of pest resistance to chemicals- an increasing organic food market and the negative effects of chemicals on the health of people and the environment- has increased the need to control insect pests biologically.--Biological control uses live organisms to kill or eat the pest insects. These organisms - called natural enemies or antagonists - are predators- parasites or micro-organisms which can bring disease and death.--Insect parasitoids are one form of biological control. These are insects which develop as parasites on other arthropods- mostly insects- causing their death or sterility. They can target each developmental stage of the insect: eggs- larvae or pupae. They've received increased attention because they are efficient- cheaper and offer a management strategy that safeguards human health and the environment.--Two species of these parasitoids have been discovered by us and our colleagues in Kenya. They have found to be efficient biological control agents against two major maize pests: the Cotesia typhae to control the maize stemborer- Sesamia nonagrioides- which has invaded France. And Cotesia icipe to control the fall armyworm- Spodoptera frugiperda- in Africa.--Sesamia nonagrioides is an African cereal stemborer that invaded Europe and the near and middle East about 100 000 years ago. It's become a major pest for maize and- due to global warming- it's spreading.--The other major maize pest is the fall armyworm. This invasive species- originally from tropical areas in the Americas- invaded sub-Saharan Africa in 2016. It has now spread to Asia and Australia and has the potential to soon spread in Europe. African countries have faced major maize shortages and billions of dollars worth of damage due to the devastation caused by the fall armyworm and the increased cost of pesticide applied.--There are other parasitoids that can kill these pests. But they are not always present in nature. Understanding the prevalence and effectiveness of these other parasitoids is important. We must ensure that the parasitoids that we will introduce won't interfere with non-target Lepidoptera species and other natural enemies present in nature that can already parasitise the targeted pest.--We hope that- within the next two to three years- the discovery of these new parasitoids will be an effective way to control these devastating insect pests.--Cotesia typhae--The French National Research Institute for Sustainable Development (IRD) started conducting studies in Kenya with the International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology (icipe) to evaluate the diversity- abundance and distribution of stemborers and their natural enemies- particularly parasitoids- in wild habitats around cultivated grasses in East Africa.--After about ten years of study- a new species of parasitoid- Cotesia typhae- was discovered. It lays its eggs inside the Sesamia nonagrioides stemborer larvae which are then killed as the parasitoid feeds on them.--About 100 000 years ago Sesamia nonagrioides from Africa invaded the Mediterranean zones of Europe and then France. The insect became a major pest as it didn't come from Africa with any of its natural enemies.--So far- chemical control is the only method that's been used to reduce infestations in France. But this is a strategy that can negatively affect the health of people and the environment- and so maize growers and professionals are in demand for an efficient biocontrol agent.--After having described this new parasitoid species- the next phase of the study will consist in developing biological control of Sesamia nonagrioides using this parasitoid- Cotesia typhae. We will first need to determine how to ensure it successfully parasitises the French population of the stemborer and to evaluate how introducing this new species might affect non-target stemborers.--Cotesia icipe--The second parasitoid- discovered by the International Centre of Insect Physiology and Ecology in Kenya is Cotesia icipe. It was found to be an effective natural enemy of the Fall Armyworm in Africa.--The recent ""invasion"" of Fall Armyworm- Spodoptera frugiperda- in Africa seriously limit maize yields by infesting the crop throughout its growth stages from- seedling to maturity. The use of chemical pesticides seems to be most common practice used to control the pest- but these can be harmful- particularly to the environment as they can affect non-targeted organisms- like bees.--Through extensive field surveys in East Africa- several indigenous parasitoids which attack the armyworm at its larval stage- were found. This included a new species of parasitoid named Cotesia icipe. It successfully parasitised 45% of Fall Armyworm.--The next phase will focus on developing biological control of the Fall Armyworm in East Africa using Cotesia icipe and other parasitoids.--These studies aim to propose a solution to the lack of full control methods against two major maize pests. It provides good biological control solutions which should fulfil environmental safety regulations while being efficient and economically sound.--We are now putting together feasibility studies for governments- on introducing these parasitoids into their new environments."
2,"Last week on April 22 the world marked the 50th anniversary of Earth Day. Air pollution in the world's major cities was down dramatically; for the first time in decades- the Himalayan Mountains could be seen from 100 miles away. The canals in Venice were so clear you could see the fish swimming in them- and lions were sleeping on the roads in South Africa. All of these developments- and others like them- were the consequences of a global reduction in fossil-fuel emissions.--Alas- none of this is the result of popular political pressure to finally bring fossil-fuel capitalism to heel. It is- rather- a byproduct of the economic shutdowns and travel restrictions that have been put in place by most nations in order to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus. Still- amidst so much death and fear- the Earth's resilience has been a symbol of hope and a source of joy- if a melancholy joy- for many.--Also last week- for the first time in history- the price of oil fell to below zero as suppliers were willing to pay to have it taken off their hands. The oil market collapse- of course- is caused by the same public health measures that have helped the planet heal: Demand for oil has plummeted. In environmental terms- falling demand for oil is the best news since...well- let's just say long before sliced bread.--Conversely- it has never been clearer that demand for oil = bad news for the planet and its inhabitants. To put this in perspective: Covid-19 has killed 200-000+ to date; air pollution kills an estimated 7 million people annually.--But if you're looking for corporate media to celebrate the good news of the drop in demand for oil- you will be disappointed. Heck- you won't even find an acknowledgement of the tradeoffs of oil demand and planetary health in last week's breathless coverage of the unprecedented market collapse. And forget any analysis about the possibilities of directing government aid to conversion to renewable energy sources.--On the contrary. I looked at last week's news coverage of the oil market collapse in four leading corporate outlets: New York Times- Washington Post- CNN and PBS NewsHour. Not a single piece included mention of the positive effects of decreased fossil fuel use- even as these outlets ran separate feel-good pieces about animals roaming free.--On the PBS News Hour (4/21/20)- a piece that promised a ""closer look"" at the oil market plunge lamented that ""no one is consuming energy at the rates they used to-"" treating this as a problem to be fixed: ""Until that corrects itself-"" it explained- the industry's woes would continue. From an amoral supply and demand perspective without context- obviously falling demand is bad for a market; but to talk about increasing fossil fuel consumption as a correction- when we know that it is precisely that consumption that is destroying the planet- is irresponsible if not immoral.--The New York Times ran several articles on the industry last week- and honestly- it was hard to tell them apart. I'm tempted to do a Freudian analysis of the word choices in ""'I'm Just Living a Nightmare': Oil Industry Braces for Devastation"" (4/21/20). The industry ""braces for devastation.""... The planet is already experiencing devastation. One industry executive worried that ""the current disorderly market has adversely damaged the industry.""... No word on the damage to the environment. He talked about ""unsustainable"" prices.... Crickets from the paper of record on unsustainable oil consumption. Another oil executive said- ""The future is very cloudy right now""...unlike the skies- which are clear for the first time in decades. (Italics added.)--In ""What the Negative Price of Oil Is Telling Us"" (4/21/20)- the Times reassures us- ""The good news is... the oil will still be in the ground once the economy starts to recover."" Lest you misunderstand this good news as a ""keep it in the soil"" idea- let me clarify that from the oil industry/New York Times point of view- ""will still be in the ground"" is good news because they can continue to get it out of the soil -- contrary to every scientific warning about the need to stop extraction immediately.--As these corporate news organizations sought to reassure their audiences that eventually the oil industry will ""correct"" itself- the only solutions on their horizon were temporary production cuts and government subsidies so that business as usual could resume once the crisis ends (again- the ""crisis"" being a global decline in fossil-fuel consumption). Conveniently forgotten is the reality that business as usual is the real problem for the planet and its inhabitants.--""Shutting down oil wells and then restarting them when demand returns can require expensive manpower and equipment. Fields do not always recover their former production-"" the New York Times (4/20/20) said in explaining why even now- when there is an unprecedented oil glut- companies continue to drill. The article went on to say- ""The oil industry's plight is forcing policymakers to consider intervening more forcefully."" It's taken for granted here that fields recovering their former production is the goal. Intervening ""forcefully"" here means temporary government-enforced production quotas -- not- say- ending further drilling and subsidizing renewable energy development.--Over at the Washington Post- it was clear that government intervention also means federal bailouts for the industry (""As Price of Oil Drops- Trump Orders Plan to Help US Energy Companies"" -- 4/21/20). Trump has ordered his administration ""to come up with a plan to provide federal assistance to the oil and gas industry-"" it reported. Apart from passing mention that the assistance might come from the Fed's small business loan program- there is no discussion of what such assistance might look like -- or whether any conditions might be attached to it.--If the oil industry needs government assistance to survive- then this is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to use that unique leverage to correct energy policy that is literally killing the planet. The government ought to be prohibiting all future drilling and offering significant subsidies to energy companies on the condition that they keep their workers on payroll and transition entirely to renewable energy sources.--This isn't rocket science- as they say; it's obvious. The failure of corporate media to make any mention of such a redirection of investment is appalling.--(By the way- this Post article was- as far as I can tell- the only piece in the four outlets that included even a single quote from a climate justice advocate: Greenpeace staffer Jack Shapiro- who was critical of a federal bailout of fossil-fuel industries.)--At CNN (4/16/20)- it was more of the same: discussion of falling demand as a ""crisis"" (""Global Oil Crisis: Bottom of the Barrel Is Still Unclear"")- and resumption of pre-coronavirus consumption levels as ""recovery.""--In ""Will the Coronavirus Pandemic Doom North Sea Oil?"" -- published April 22- the 50th anniversary of Earth Day -- the New York Times (4/22/20) wistfully described ""a proud yet declining industry"" and the impact of falling oil prices on communities like Aberdeen- Scotland. Once again- the narrative horizon extends no further than understanding demand for oil as a positive:--""Demand will come back- but it won't come back fast-"" said Mike Tholen- director of sustainability at Oil and Gas UK- which represents the North Sea industry. ""We may be in an era of having seen peak oil demand-"" he added. Analysts say that governments will likely continue to promote measures to tackle climate change by cutting carbon-dioxide emissions- which means reduced demand for oil.--This piece illustrates some of the fallout for communities and regions from market shifts like the current oil crash -- jobs lost- ripple effects on other industries- declining tax revenue- etc. Ultimately- these are human costs of economic upheaval- and the way they have played out in our global capitalist economy thus far is invariably brutal and unfair.--This reality makes the refusal to look beyond continued investment in oil all the more infuriating- baffling -- and depressing. The paucity of imagination on display in the corporate coverage of last week's oil market crash is ultimately a reflection of the continued economic- political and ideological power of neoliberalism.--Which brings us back to the clear skies and reduced air pollution. Since the planet's reprieve is an unintended side effect of Covid-19 public health measures- rather than the outcome of redirected political priorities and economic investments- it has been treated as a quirky byproduct that must be temporary- even if it is charming in some ways.--The ""crisis"" of falling oil demand is- ironically- a self-inflicted capitalist wound. The same unfettered corporate power that has driven global warming has given us the coronavirus crisis: the commodification of rights and goods that should never be commodified -- in particular- in this instance- for-profit healthcare; gross economic inequalities stoked by white supremacist and patriarchal ideologies; and political priorities that ignore social goods and starve the government infrastructures needed to respond to the viral outbreak. In the absence of adequate public health responses- massive physical distancing -- and its economic consequences -- has been the only way governments have been able to even partially limit illness and death.--It's a bitter irony- entirely lost on corporate media."
55,Mandatory lockdowns imposed by many governments have seen a massive reduction in the carbon footprint associated with daily human activity.--Several reports show a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions and other forms of pollution since the outbreak of the deadly coronavirusThe majority of cryptocurrency assets- along with the entire global financial sector have taken a sizeable hit in the last... More. With the real culprits causing environmental degradation currently sidelined- it is becoming clear that Bitcoin mining is only a drop in the ocean in the grand scheme of things related to global warming.--Global warming and its acceleration of climate change was an issue long before the energy consumption associated with Bitcoin mining operations reached a significant level. Critics quickly began comparing Bitcoin's energy consumption to that of countries like Switzerland- Denmark- and the Czech Republic.--As with most Bitcoin-related FUD- strip away the attempt at grandstanding and the facts fail to support the rhetoric espoused by these 'nocoiners.' Take- for example- the U.S. Military -- its fuel usage alone reportedly equals that of Peru and Portugal- with a combined population of about 43 million people. Indeed- the U.S Military's carbon footprint is equivalent to that of about 140 countries.--According to multiple reports- the stay at home order enacted by several governments is causing cleaner air in urban cities- especially those in Asia. According to a report by Channel News Asia (CNA)- air pollution in Bangkok- Thailand is down 20 percent due to the isolation measures caused by the coronavirus pandemic.--The situation is the same for many cities in the Asia Pacific and across the world occasioned by the reduction in pollutants expelled by heavy industries- oil refineries- vehicles- and airplanes to mention a few.--The virus has- on the other hand- not affected Bitcoin mining activities. Apart from a 45 percent hash rate plunge in late March- the network's computational power isn't far off from its all-time high.--With Bitcoin mining increasingly utilizing renewable energy sources- the ocean boiling narrative has continued to lack merit. Indeed- Bitcoin miners have become a buyer of last resort for clean energy producers. In its bi-annual report back in December 2019- Coinshares revealed that 73 percent of Bitcoin mining energy consumption came from renewable sources.--Apart from utilizing cleaner energy sources- Bitcoin mining giants are also developing more energy-efficient hardware. Major players like Bitmain and MicroBT have recently announced the roll-out of machines that lower watts per terahash (W/T) ratios. (The W/T ratio refers to the amount of electricity consumed to deliver one terahash of computational activity on the network. Both companies have announced new miners with significantly lower W/T ratios than their current models.)--While this race to obtain more energy-efficient mining hardware is mostly driven by the upcoming block reward halving- Bitcoin's energy consumption is about to experience another reduction. When not utilizing renewable energy sources or moving towards more efficient mining hardware- miners are helping major culprits of environmental pollution to reduce activities that negatively impact the environment.--In North America- Bitcoin miners are buying gas normally flared by oil well operators. Rather than releasing greenhouse gases like methane to the atmosphere- Bitcoin mining is helping oil companies reduce their harmful carbon footprint while eliminating waste from the petroleum exploration process.
86,"A record-breaking ozone hole that formed over the Arctic this spring has closed- researchers announced late last week.--Scientists at the Copernicus' Atmospheric Monitoring Service tracking the ""rather unusual"" ozone hole announced Thursday on Twitter that it had ended. The group said the hole was caused by a polar vortex and closed when that vortex split.--""COVID19 and the associated lockdowns probably had nothing to do with this-"" the group said repeatedly on Twitter. ""It's been driven by an unusually strong and long-lived polar vortex- and isn't related to air quality changes.""--In Antarctica: Ozone hole shrinks to smallest size on record- and it's not related to global warming--A polar vortex is a large area of cold air high in the atmosphere that normally spins over the North Pole. An ozone hole is a dramatic thinning of the ozone layer that's typically boosted in size by colder temperatures.--Ozone holes have formed annually for the past 35 years in the Antarctic because of human-made chemicals migrating into the stratosphere and accumulating inside a strong polar vortex- the group said. Because of unusually warm temperatures high above Antarctica- the ozone hole shrank to its smallest size on record last October.--Story continues--In the Arctic however- polar vortexes are much weaker- meaning the conditions needed for such strong ozone depletion aren't normally found- making this ozone hole ""unprecedented.""--Ozone depletion over the Arctic in 2020 was so severe that most of the ozone at an altitude of around 11 miles had been depleted. Researchers said the last time a similarly strong chemical ozone depletion was observed over the Arctic was in spring 2011.--The ozone layer is important because it acts like a sunscreen- blocking potentially harmful ultraviolet energy from reaching our planet's surface. Without it- humans and animals can experience increased rates of skin cancer and other ailments such as cataracts.--The naturally occurring ozone high up in the atmosphere is the ""good"" ozone and is in contrast to the ""bad"" ozone near the surface- which is man-made pollution that can cause respiratory problems.--Follow N'dea Yancey-Bragg on Twitter: @NdeaYanceyBragg--This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Record-breaking Arctic ozone hole closes- but not due to coronavirus"
102,"Watch our editor-in-chief Koert Debeuf explain the reasons in this 30-second video.--Like many state and other non-state actors- terrorist groups manipulate the global pandemic in their radical narratives. They do so to unify their followers- attract new sympathisers- and further their objectives.--Daesh sees in the coronavirus ""a torment sent by Allah to his enemies"". China would be particularly hard-hit as punishment for its treatment of Uighur Muslims- and it is no coincidence that Iran's holy Shiite city Qom is one of the new epicentres of the outbreak.--Far-right terrorists also blame their enemies hoping to radicalise others and promote their goals. They see the pandemic as a result of a biological weapon deployed by China- aimed at destroying Western powers- or blame migrants for causing its spread.--Terrorist groups also use the pandemic to gain visibility. Daesh- for instance- has been exploiting hashtags related to the coronavirus to redirect users to their radical propaganda. European extremist groups also capitalise on current fear and chaos to incite followers to commit attacks.--Neo-nazi groups encourage supporters to stir panic during the coronavirus outbreak and anarchist groups have called on members to commit attacks- as police forces would be overburdened with corona-related tasks.--The coronavirus pandemic has already caused high numbers of deaths- massive economic disruption- and had a huge impact on the daily lives of millions of people. In short- everything terrorists would want to achieve with their attacks.--No surprise thus that the global pandemic serves as inspiration and influences the modus operandi of terrorists- both in terms of tactics and target selection.--Terrorist networks have encouraged followers to weaponise their own illness by trying to infect others. The pandemic might also serve as inspiration for their long-term strategies- leading to a potential rise of attempts to commit biological attacks.--Similar attacks occur fortunately very rarely; the most significant bio-terror attacks to date are a salmonellosis outbreak in Oregon- committed by the Rajneesh sect in the mid-80s- and the more than two dozen anthrax or ricin-laced letters in the early 2000s.--Terrorists have also found inspiration in the global pandemic with regards to their target selection- in particular critical health infrastructures.--Recently- the FBI killed a far-right terrorist- who had accelerated his attack plan and changed the target to a hospital treating Covid-19 patients.--For terrorists- the current crisis also serves as an ideal case study to learn about the threats and effects of atypical warfare methods and could thus inspire them to adopt innovative attacks- such as disruptions in the food supply or medicine and other health supplies.--'Apocalyptic-ism' plays an important role in many terrorist narratives.--Violent extremists thus will most likely play out the apocalyptic narrative of the pandemic to spur their supporters to action.--Jihadist groups have seen in the coronavirus pandemic a sign that the world is approaching the Day of Judgement. In the past- a similar doomsday narrative has served as a crucial recruiting pitch for foreign fighters to fight with Daesh in the final battles of the apocalypse.--Also right-wing extremists- who believe the world is heading towards a genocidal race war- might see in the apocalyptic scenarios of the pandemic a call for violent action.--The Covid-19 outbreak could also lead to a rise of violent actions by the hands of environmental extremists. Economic difficulties- a lack of public support- and more urgent needs might thwart advances in the global warming agenda and interrupt green investments by national governments.--Moreover- having witnessed the immediate environmental benefits due to radical actions like a global lockdown and economic disruption- eco-activists could be triggered to resort to violence.--The pandemic is showing its first effects on terrorism. The global pandemic could- however- also have a long-term impact on Europe's counter-terrorism measures.--Particularly worrying is the risk of a possible application of epidemiological tracking tools for counter-terrorism purposes.--Both democratic and non-democratic countries have- under the exceptionalism of emergency laws and with various degrees of invasiveness- introduced wide-spread contact and movement digital tracking tools aimed to determine the whereabouts of an infected person.--A future 'national emergency' situation- in the aftermath of a major terrorist attack- could pave the way for adding such apps to the counter-terrorism toolbox.--However- similar wide-spread and systematic analytical tools to survey the spread of radicalism would not only threaten a number of fundamental rights- but would also be ineffective.--Based on an idea that radicalisation is contagious and spreads by the mere interaction between people- it would risk increasing stigmatisation and other grievances among segments of the population and eventually create new breeding grounds for extremism in the EU."
108,"Below are the movies that Johnson has appeared in throughout her career- ranked by critical consensus on Rotten Tomatoes.--Since appearing in her first film at age 9- actress Dakota Johnson has made a name for herself through the popular romance franchise- ""Fifty Shades of Grey."" She has also had roles in critically acclaimed movies like ""The Social Network-"" ""The Peanut Butter Falcon-"" and ""Suspiria.""--The actress has been in 23 films total- but some of them have been more well-received than others.--Here are all of the movies that Johnson has appeared in- ranked according to critical consensus on Rotten Tomatoes.--Note: All scores were current on the date of publication and are subject to change.--Rotten Tomatoes score: 0%--Synopsis: In ""Chloe & Theo-"" the actress played the titular Chloe- a homeless New Yorker who teams up with Theo (Theo Ikummaq)- an Inuit man from the Arctic- to warn world leaders about global warming's catastrophic impact on the planet.--While critics acknowledged the movie's timely message- most found it too simplified and caricatured to be effective.--""There's a line between a narrative that's deliberately simple and one that's painfully childish- and it's not all that fine-"" wrote Daniel M. Gold for The New York Times. ""But it's one 'Chloe & Theo' crosses repeatedly.""--Rotten Tomatoes score: 12%--Synopsis: In ""Fifty Shades Freed-"" the third and final installment in the erotic romance franchise ""Fifty Shades of Grey-"" Christian (Jamie Dornan) and Anastasia (Johnson) marry and face rocky challenges in their newlywed lifestyle.--The sequel was almost universally panned- but Johnson received praise for giving life to a character that often lacked dimension.--""The movie's tone replicates its substance: the impersonally crafted- emptily realized- expensively produced movie gets its modicum of humanity from Dakota Johnson- who has the gift of simply seeming alive and present when she's on camera-"" wrote The New Yorker critic Richard Brody.--Rotten Tomatoes score: 12%--Synopsis: In the second ""Fifty Shades"" installment- Christian (Dornan) and Anastasia (Johnson) are attempting to rebuild their relationship after breaking up at the end of the first movie. As they work to regain each other's trust- mysterious figures from Christian's past begin to pop up in unnerving ways.--""I came away [from 'Fifty Shades of Grey'] with a deep sense of respect for Dakota Johnson- who has the incredibly unenviable task of making Ana Steele seem like a real person-"" wrote Sarah Marshall for The New Republic. ""[...] Johnson's success with the role comes largely from her ability to make this passive bewilderment seem somehow credible.""--Rotten Tomatoes score: 19%--Synopsis: ""Goats"" follows a teenage boy named Ellis (Graham Phillips)- who prepares to leave his rural Tuscon home and attend an elite prep school. At his new school- he falls in love with Minnie (Johnson)- a local girl who may be a prostitute.--The film was largely criticized for lacking substance beyond its quirky- episodic format- and for wasting its talented cast on one-note characters.--""A coming-of-age story without any clear epiphany- 'Goats' meanders rather aimlessly through 92 minutes of running time much like its titular ruminants- fumbling to achieve genuine audience engagement-"" wrote Justin Lowe for The Hollywood Reporter.--Rotten Tomatoes score: 20%--Synopsis: ""Beastly"" is a modern take on ""Beauty and the Beast-"" in which the Beast is an obnoxious high schooler (Alex Pettyfer) who is physically transformed by a classmate's (Mary-Kate Olsen) spell in order to learn the error of his shallow ways.--Critical consensus found that ""Beastly"" was fundamentally misguided- and contributed little to the legacy of its classic source material.--""In every aspect- from story to tone to characterization to visual aesthetic- ['Beastly' is] laughably perfunctory- as though everyone involved were too embarrassed to give it more than a half-ironic token effort-"" wrote The A.V. Club critic Tasha Robinson.--Rotten Tomatoes score: 23%--Synopsis: Based on the racing video game franchise of the same name- ""Need For Speed"" follows a mechanic and auto-racer named Tobey (Aaron Paul)- who fights to get revenge on the man who framed him for a crime (Dominic Cooper) two years earlier - all while bounty hunters and cops pursue him.--Johnson appeared in the largely maligned action movie as Anita- Tobey's ex-girlfriend.--""[Director] Scott Waugh's relentlessly noisy- abrasive action movie is based on a computer game - and it shows-"" wrote The Independent critic Geoffrey Macnab. ""The characterization and plotting are as crude as the car chases are slick.""--Rotten Tomatoes score: 25%--Synopsis: Arguably- Johnson's most famous role to date is playing Anastasia Steele in the ""Fifty Shades"" franchise. The first installment follows Anastasia- a naive recent college grad who enters into a BDSM relationship with enigmatic billionaire Christian Grey.--Although ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" fared slightly better than its predecessors with critics- its clichéd story beats and surprisingly unerotic romantic scenes still proved to be detrimental.--""In the annals of sexually-charged event cinema- 'Fifty Shades of Grey' barely lights a candle let alone combusts with unbridled forbidden passion-"" wrote Susan Wloszczyna for RogertEgbert.com.--Rotten Tomatoes score: 30%--Synopsis: ""Date and Switch"" centers on Matty (Hunter Cope) and Michael (Nicholas Braun)- two teenage best friends whose plans to lose their virginity before senior prom are changed when Matty comes out as gay. Johnson portrayed Em- Matty's supportive ex-girlfriend.--""In its sloppy humor and unabashedly earnest expressions of friendship and romance- ['Date and Switch'] feels like any likable- and generally forgettable- teen comedy-"" wrote New York Daily News critic Elizabeth Weitzman. ""And yet with its casually handled twist- the genre ambles forward just a little bit.""--Rotten Tomatoes score: 30%--Synopsis: At 9 years old- the actress appeared alongside her mother- actress Melanie Griffith- in ""Crazy in Alabama"" (which was directed by her then-stepfather- Antonio Banderas). In the film- Griffith starred as a '60s housewife who flees to Hollywood and attempts to be an actress after impulsively murdering her husband. Back in Alabama- her nephew (Lucas Black) becomes increasingly involved with the civil rights movement.--Banderas' dramedy received a lukewarm reception- mainly for its struggle to juggle the various genres and themes at play in the story.--""'Crazy in Alabama' is an ungainly fit of three stories that have no business being shoehorned into the same movie-"" Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert.--Rotten Tomatoes score: 31%--Synopsis: Johnson played the daughter of a drug kingpin (Ed Harris) in ""Cymbeline-"" a modern adaptation of Shakespeare's play of the same name. The story revolves around the war that erupts between a corrupt police force and a local drug-dealing biker gang.--In attempting to transform ""Cymbeline"" into a gritty- contemporary drama- director Michael Almereyda faced criticism for creating an overstuffed- unpoetic end product.--""['Cymbeline' is] a mash-up of social media shortcomings and Shakespearean tragedy that becomes as much a tale of cinematic ambition gone awry as anything the Bard intended-"" wrote Los Angeles Times critic Betsy Sharkley.--Rotten Tomatoes score: 47%--Synopsis: ""How To Be Single"" follows Alice (Johnson)- a recent college grad who breaks up with her long-term boyfriend and moves to New York City to work as a paralegal. Once she arrives- Alice's free-wheeling new coworker- Robin (Wilson)- attempts to help her navigate her newfound singlehood.--Although ""How To Be Single"" received mixed reviews- many critics appreciated the movie's attempts to blend rom-com tropes with more progressive ideas surrounding modern dating.--""How to Be Single is a lot like its Jager-bombing- romance-seeking protagonists: Cute and goofy and kind of a mess-"" wrote Entertainment Weekly critic Leah Greenblatt. ""[The film] doesn't come close to reinventing the rom-com wheel; its creators aren't even trying to- really. But at least they're spinning it forward- just a little bit.""--Rotten Tomatoes score: 51%--Synopsis: ""Wounds"" unfolds as a bartender (""Call Me By Your Name"" star Armie Hammer) begins receiving disturbing texts and calls from a lost phone that he discovered at work. His girlfriend- Carrie (Johnson)- becomes obsessed with investigating the strange messages- which increasingly terrorize them both.--While ""Wounds"" has its share of spine-tingling scares and effective body horror- reviews often described it as ham-fisted and thematically empty.--""'Wounds' creeps and crawls and pokes and bleeds but it never really works-"" wrote The Guardian critic Benjamin Lee.--Rotten Tomatoes score: 63%--Synopsis: At the start of ""The Five-Year Engagement-"" young couple Tom (Segel) and Violet (Blunt) get engaged. However- as the title suggests- they face a long road to their wedding day- as various obstacles force them to move the date and reevaluate whether they're right for each other.--Johnson plays Audrey- a restaurant hostess who dates Tom during his brief separation from Violet.--""['The Five-Year Engagement' is an] exemplary modern romantic comedy- personal and symbolic- goofy and substantial- tightly imagined yet loosely strung- wise in bewilderment-"" wrote Richard Brody for The New Yorker.--Rotten Tomatoes score: 65%--Synopsis: ""Suspiria"" is a remake of horror auteur Dario Argento's 1977 horror movie of the same name. It centers on Susie (Johnson)- a naive dancer who joins a prestigious ballet company that's actually a front for an ancient witch coven.--The 2018 version of ""Suspiria"" proved to be divisive due to its bleak- garish approach to the story- but Johnson enjoyed praise for ably embodying both Susie's doe-eyed innocence and later- darker demeanor.--""Johnson finally has a role befitting her talents-"" wrote USA Today critic Brian Truitt. ""There's an enticingly quiet intensity in her Susie- who takes some major turns in the tale that the actress navigates with grace- and Johnson captures just the right physicality in the various modern dances that ground the movie with a primordial weight and sexual energy.""--Rotten Tomatoes score: 67%--Synopsis: In the indie drama ""For Ellen-"" aspiring rockstar Joby (Paul Dano) is in the midst of divorce proceedings- in which he's expected to receive much-needed money from the sale of his and his estranged wife's old house. But he soon learns that agreeing to the settlement would mean forfeiting custody of his 6-year-old daughter.--Johnson has a small role in the movie as Joby's sister- Cindy- who advises him on how to regain custody of his daughter.--""In other hands- ['For Ellen'] could play as glib comedy or slick sentiment- yet [director So Yong] Kim's patient- clear-sighted film moves to the urgings of tough emotional realities rather than obvious story patterns-"" wrote Trevor Johnston for Time Out. ""It's uncomfortably funny- achingly true - and the work of an absolutely genuine artist.""--Rotten Tomatoes score: 73%--Synopsis: Johnny Depp played the infamous crime lord Whitey Bulger in ""Black Mass-"" which was largely hailed by critics for its enticing dramatization of mob dealings and haunting lead performances. Johnson co-starred in the film as Whitey's wife- Lindsey.--""['Black Mass' is] one of those movies that you don't exactly enjoy (so many guns- so many deaths)- but you appreciate for its craft and tension- and for its cast's willingness to lose themselves in the darkness-"" wrote Moira MacDonald for The Seattle Times.--Rotten Tomatoes score: 75%--Synopsis: Set in 1969- ""Bad Times at the El Royale"" tells the story of seven strangers- who unexpectedly congregate in a shadowy motel one night and are forced to divulge dark secrets. Johnson starred in the ne0-noir as Emily Summerspring- a hippie who commits an apparent kidnapping at the beginning of the film.--The movie received largely positive reviews- although some critics took issue with its long runtime and slightly uneven pacing.--""Yes- 'Bad Times at the El Royale' is bloated and might've functioned better as a punchy bit of neo-noir-"" wrote David Sims for The Atlantic. ""But it's rare for a genre film to feel so sweeping and inventive [...] There might be too much going on- but as the final act descends into carnage- Goddard is at least trying to say something.""--Rotten Tomatoes score: 75%--Synopsis: Carrie Brownstein and musician St. Vincent (whose real name is Annie Clark) play versions of themselves in the music mockumentary ""The Nowhere Inn.""

112,A new report from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says there is a 75 percent chance that 2020 will be the hottest year in recorded history.--Despite major reductions in air pollution across the world during COVID-19 shutdowns- climate scientists predict temperatures will continue to rise because of how much cumulative greenhouse gases are already in the atmosphere.--If 2020 doesn't pass the previous hottest year on record- 2016- the NOAA says it's all but certain to rank in the top five- all of which have happened since 2015.--The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Global Climate Report says there's a 75 percent chance that 2020 will be the hottest year on record- passing the previous high of 2016--'The emissions will go down this year- but the concentrations keep on rising-' University of Oxford climate scientist Karsten Haustein told The Guardian. 'We are very unlikely to be able to notice any slowdown in the built-up of atmospheric GHG levels.'--'But we have the unique chance now to reconsider our choices and use the corona crisis as a catalyst for more sustainable means of transport and energy production (via incentives- taxes- carbon prices etc).'--An earlier estimate from The Met Office also put the odds of 2020 being the hotest year yet on record at 50 percent.--WHAT ARE THE HOTTEST YEARS ON RECORD?--The hottest years ever recorded are:--2016201920152017201820142010201320052009--Source: Climate Central--NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York recently released their own report giving a 60 percent chance that 2020 will pass 2016's previous high.--Whether this year- actually breaks the previous record- climate scientists agree the warming trend in recent years could lead to environmental catastrophe.--'Greenhouse gas concentrations are at the highest levels in three million years - when the Earth's temperature was as much as three degrees hotter and sea levels some 15 meters higher-' UN Antonio Guterres said in March.--'Ocean heat is at a record level- with temperatures rising at the equivalent of five Hiroshima bombs a second.'--2020 has already seen a number of record-breaking highs- with the hottest January on record- with some parts of Europe experiencing temperatures 10.8 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than the 1981-2010 averages.--In February- temperatures in Antartica reached a shocking 68 degrees Fahrenheit- and average global temperatures were the second hottest ever- behind 2016.--WHAT IS AIR POLLUTION?--Emissions--Carbon dioxide--Carbon dioxide (CO2) is one of the biggest contributors to global warming. After the gas is released into the atmosphere it stays there- making it difficult for heat to escape - and warming up the planet in the process.--It is primarily released from burning fossil fuels such as coal- oil and gas- as well as cement production.--The average monthly concentration of CO2 in the Earth's atmosphere- as of April 2019- is 413 parts per million (ppm). Before the Industrial Revolution- the concentration was just 280 ppm.--CO2 concentration has fluctuated over the last 800-000 years between 180 to 280ppm- but has been vastly accelerated by pollution caused by humans.--AirVisual Privacy Policy--Nitrogen dioxide--The gas nitrogen dioxide (NO2) comes from burning fossil fuels- car exhaust emissions and the use of nitrogen-based fertilisers used in agriculture.--Although there is far less NO2 in the atmosphere than CO2- it is between 200 and 300 times more effective at trapping heat.--Sulfur dioxide--Sulfur dioxide (SO2) also primarily comes from fossil fuel burning- but can also be released from car exhausts.--SO2 can react with water- oxygen and other chemicals in the atmosphere to cause acid rain.--Carbon monoxide--Carbon monoxide (CO) is an indirect greenhouse gas as it reacts with hydroxyl radicals- removing them. Hydroxyl radicals reduce the lifetime of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.--Particulates--What is particulate matter?--Particulate matter refers to tiny parts of solids or liquid materials in the air.--Some are visible- such as dust- whereas others cannot be seen by the naked eye.--Materials such as metals- microplastics- soil and chemicals can be in particulate matter.--Particulate matter (or PM) is described in micrometres. The two main ones mentioned in reports and studies are PM10 (less than 10 micrometres) and PM2.5 (less than 2.5 micrometres).--Air pollution comes from burning fossil fuels- cars- cement making and agriculture--Scientists measure the rate of particulates in the air by cubic metre.--Particulate matter is sent into the air by a number of processes including burning fossil fuels- driving cars and steel making.--Why are particulates dangerous?--Particulates are dangerous because those less than 10 micrometres in diameter can get deep into your lungs- or even pass into your bloodstream. Particulates are found in higher concentrations in urban areas- particularly along main roads.--Health impact--What sort of health problems can pollution cause?--According to the World Health Organization- a third of deaths from stroke- lung cancer and heart disease can be linked to air pollution.--Some of the effects of air pollution on the body are not understood- but pollution may increase inflammation which narrows the arteries leading to heart attacks or strokes.--As well as this- almost one in 10 lung cancer cases in the UK are caused by air pollution.--Particulates find their way into the lungs and get lodged there- causing inflammation and damage. As well as this- some chemicals in particulates that make their way into the body can cause cancer.--Deaths from pollution--Around seven million people die prematurely because of air pollution every year. Pollution can cause a number of issues including asthma attacks- strokes- various cancers and cardiovascular problems.--Asthma triggers--Air pollution can cause problems for asthma sufferers for a number of reasons. Pollutants in traffic fumes can irritate the airways- and particulates can get into your lungs and throat and make these areas inflamed.--Problems in pregnancy--Women exposed to air pollution before getting pregnant are nearly 20 per cent more likely to have babies with birth defects- research suggested in January 2018.--Living within 3.1 miles (5km) of a highly-polluted area one month before conceiving makes women more likely to give birth to babies with defects such as cleft palates or lips- a study by University of Cincinnati found.--For every 0.01mg/m3 increase in fine air particles- birth defects rise by 19 per cent- the research adds.--Previous research suggests this causes birth defects as a result of women suffering inflammation and 'internal stress'.--What is being done to tackle air pollution?--Paris agreement on climate change--The Paris Agreement- which was first signed in 2015- is an international agreement to control and limit climate change.--It hopes to hold the increase in the global average temperature to below 2°C (3.6ºF) 'and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C (2.7°F)'.--Carbon neutral by 2050--The UK government has announced plans to make the country carbon neutral by 2050.--They plan to do this by planting more trees and by installing 'carbon capture' technology at the source of the pollution.--Some critics are worried that this first option will be used by the government to export its carbon offsetting to other countries.--International carbon credits let nations continue emitting carbon while paying for trees to be planted elsewhere- balancing out their emissions.--No new petrol or diesel vehicles by 2040--In 2017- the UK government announced the sale of new petrol and diesel cars would be banned by 2040.--From around 2020- town halls will be allowed to levy extra charges on diesel drivers using the UK's 81 most polluted routes if air quality fails to improve.--However- MPs on the climate change committee have urged the government to bring the ban forward to 2030- as by then they will have an equivalent range and price.--The Paris Agreement- which was first signed in 2015- is an international agreement to control and limit climate change. Pictured: air pollution over Paris in 2019.--Norway's electric car subsidies--The speedy electrification of Norway's automotive fleet is attributed mainly to generous state subsidies. Electric cars are almost entirely exempt from the heavy taxes imposed on petrol and diesel cars- which makes them competitively priced.--A VW Golf with a standard combustion engine costs nearly 334-000 kroner (34-500 euros- $38-600)- while its electric cousin the e-Golf costs 326-000 kroner thanks to a lower tax quotient.--Criticisms of inaction on climate change--The Committee on Climate Change (CCC) has said there is a 'shocking' lack of Government preparation for the risks to the country from climate change.--The committee assessed 33 areas where the risks of climate change had to be addressed - from flood resilience of properties to impacts on farmland and supply chains - and found no real progress in any of them.--The UK is not prepared for 2°C of warming- the level at which countries have pledged to curb temperature rises- let alone a 4°C rise- which is possible if greenhouse gases are not cut globally- the committee said.--It added that cities need more green spaces to stop the urban 'heat island' effect- and to prevent floods by soaking up heavy rainfall.

The area includes large areas of the western United States- extending from California- Arizona and New Mexico north to Oregon and Idaho- the Washington Post notes.--The researchers used hydrological modeling and new 1-200-year tree-ring reconstructions of summer soil moisture to produce their findings. The study argues that global warming has ""pushed what would have been a moderate drought in southwestern North America into megadrought territory.""--The study of the ancient trees and their tree rings enabled the researchers to reconstruct what the climate looked like in the western U.S. in the past- according to Forbes magazine. With this method- the scientists were able to deduce the average soil moisture through time in a region then plot the soil moisture and compare historical megadroughts to current conditions.--""It seems to me that this is a very important study-"" said AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Brett Anderson.

219,"ARNOLD- Mo. (AP) -- Hollywood Beach Road was once such prime real estate that the neighborhood had its own airstrip- enabling well-heeled residents to zip back and forth between homes in nearby St. Louis and weekend cottages on the Meramec River in suburban Arnold- Missouri.--Floods eventually took their toll. Nowadays- all that remains of those waterfront dwellings are crumbling concrete foundations amid a tangle of skinny trees and beaver-gnawed stumps. Nature is reclaiming the area -- and is welcome to it- local leaders say.--Instead of building levees to keep floodwaters out- Arnold has used federal and local tax dollars to buy out hundreds of homeowners so the landscape could revert to wetlands that soak up overflow waters.--Those wetlands helped the town of 21-000 escape major damage in 2019 when the Mississippi River reached its second-highest level on record. And they reflect a pattern quietly emerging from a growing number of communities that could help the nation's midsection cope with rivers often surging beyond their banks at this time of year.--Each spring- melting snow in the north and seasonal rains send huge volumes of runoff into waterways that have been heavily armored to protect surrounding land from flooding. This system of levees- dikes and walls usually held up during the last century but is now being over-topped more frequently by heavier storms that scientists link to global warming.--Floods in the Missouri- Mississippi and Arkansas river basins caused $20 billion in damage in 2019- the second-wettest year on record. The National Weather Service forecast moderate to severe problems in 23 states this spring but said last week the risk had declined because of below-normal rainfall in the past two months. Longer term- one government assessment predicts annual flood damage in the Midwest growing by $500 million by 2050.--But the floodplain awaiting this year's surge is part of a changing picture- altered from just a few decades ago. It is now dotted with more parks- marshes and forests on land surrendered in recent years by communities and individuals. Some experts envision this expanding green patchwork as a promising model for relieving pressure on a river system that can no longer stay in its man-made channels.--""It's becoming evident that we have to do something different-"" said Colin Wellenkamp- executive director of the Mississippi River Cities and Towns Initiative. ""That increasingly means shaping our cities around the river instead of shaping the river around our cities.""--To give rivers more room to sprawl- cities are keeping adjacent lands for limited uses such as parks that can flood when rivers rise. A few rural levees have been set back or removed to create wider flow paths. Wetlands have been restored as buffers.--In Arnold- the improvement was evident after last year's Midwestern floods- said Robert Shockey- police chief and emergency management director. ""Instead of 100 homes getting wet- we have a dozen.""--No one suggests replacing levees- dams and walls as a primary means of flood control.--""But they need to be augmented by natural assets-"" said Wellenkamp- whose organization represents nearly 100 municipalities.--This approach is gradually catching state and federal policymakers' attention. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers- which has built dams and levees since the late 19th Century- is becoming more receptive.--Congress has instructed the agency in recent years to consider ""natural"" or ""nature-based"" flood control measures.--""We are definitely trying to make sure we're giving these features a fair shake-"" said Maria Wegner- senior policy adviser with the Corps headquarters in Washington- D.C.--Experts don't know exactly how many land buyouts or set-asides have taken place to create new buffers- but said the cases are adding up. Wellenkamp's organization has commissioned a study to compile a list.--Some projects emphasize restoring wildlife habitat- with flood prevention an additional benefit. In one case- the Army Corps moved back a levee south of Hannibal- Missouri- to open about 325 acres to river flow.--But for many towns- flood control is the primary motive.--Davenport- Iowa- is in the vanguard of rethinking flood control. Even after waters covered its downtown business district last year- the town decided against a flood wall. Instead- it will continue relying on parkland along its 9-mile-long Mississippi riverfront and on a 300-acre marsh.--The small town of Grafton- Illinois- perched where the Mississippi and Illinois rivers meet- also has rejected building walls that would obscure scenic views. Instead- it used sediment dredged from a marina to recreate a wetland in a shallow area of the Mississippi.--Similar projects are being tried elsewhere. Minneapolis went with natural floodwater retention basins instead of levees to protect a new mixed-use development. Dubuque- Iowa- restored a Mississippi tributary creek and floodplain paved over a century earlier. Cape Girardeau- Missouri- created a natural area for floodwaters rather than extend a wall north of town.--Skeptics question whether natural features can play a major role.--""You're seeing a little bit of a trend-"" said Nicholas Pinter- an earth sciences professor at the University of California- Davis. But such projects are ""small in scale and the exception to the rule.""--Some attempts to give rivers more room have drawn resistance -- particularly along the Missouri- the nation's longest.--Hundreds of farmers and business owners sued the Army Corps for creating more wildlife habitat along the Lower Missouri- saying it worsened flooding. And property rights activists have opposed federal plans to expand the Big Muddy National Wildlife Refuge from 16-600 to 60-000 acres by purchasing more land from willing sellers.--Still- there are signs of changing attitudes. Republican senators from Iowa- Kansas- Missouri and Nebraska introduced legislation in March that calls for the Army Corps to use ""both structural and nonstructural measures"" to reduce flooding on the Missouri.--A new Corps plan for the Lower Meramec River- hit by three record floods since August 2015- endorses wetland restoration and property buyouts.--In Atchison County- several farmland owners are negotiating to sell more than 500 acres to move back portions of a levee on the Missouri River.--""I'd much rather be farming it- but I've come to the realization that it's not going to happen-"" said tenant farmer Phil Graves- who grew corn and soybeans on land now smeared with up to four feet of sandy silt from last year's flooding.--If completed- the project could set an example for other flood-prone counties along the Missouri- said Dru Buntin- deputy director of the state Department of Natural Resources.--Already- said Buntin- ""you have landowners themselves talking about how this approach benefited them- as opposed to state or federal agencies trying to convince them.""--After last year's flooding- nearly 750 farmers in a dozen heartland states volunteered for a federal program that pays to take property out of production and restore natural features. Federal disaster legislation provided an extra $217.5 million for conservation easements in 13 hard-hit states.--""We don't have anywhere near the funding we'd need"" to accept all who want to participate- said Jon Hubbert of the Natural Resources Conservation Service office in Des Moines- Iowa.------Associated Press writer Scott McFetridge in Des Moines- Iowa- contributed to this story.--The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

389,In the country's rural villages- tens of farmers are purposely embracing bioslurry - a liquid discharge from biodigesters after gas has been tapped for energy - to nourish the soil.--Rising soil acidity across many farms is dealing heavy blows to crop yields that keep dwindling by the season.--Soil analysis conducted across farms in 25 counties in 2014 revealed high acidity levels far beyond the acceptable limit.--The research found the soil pH in breadbasket counties such as Uasin Gishu- Nandi- Trans-Nzoia and Bungoma to be quite low- hence acidic. Soil from the Uasin Gishu County for instance- measured between extremely acidic (4.35 pH) to slightly acidic (6.36 pH) on the chemical pH scale. Soils with such levels of acidity are unsuitable for farming.--The Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organisation (Kalro)- which conducted the analysis- linked the acidity to over use of inorganic fertilisers- particularly Diammonium phosphate or DAP. It recommended soil specific fertilisers to mitigate the crisis.--Also recommended was the use of liming materials to neutralise the acidity. Unfortunately- only a few smallholder farmers can afford the process- as a tonne of lime costs over Sh4-000.--Some farmers are using the by-products from bio-gas producing biodigesters as an alternative method of enhancing their farms productivity.--Joseph Tanui- a farmer in Kipreset in Uasin Gishu County- is one of those who is finding biodigesters useful. Tanui grows Boma Rhodes grass on a two-acre plot and vegetables on a quarter acre.--He explained that he collects fresh cow dung from his neighbours which he supplements with those from his own two cows to feed his biogas plant.--To make a bioslurry water and cow dung and mixed in a 1:1 ratio then left to ferment.--During the fermentation natural microorganisms break down the manure to produce biogas (in the form of methane gas). Another by-product is- compost- which adds humus in the soil.--Researchers say that if the methane gas is not captured through biogas production- a lot of it ends up in the atmosphere where it damages the ozone layer leading to global warming.--Kevin Kinisu- Kenya Biogas Programme country manager- points out that more than 22-000 households in the country have adopted the technology- sequestering over 417-000 tonnes equivalent of carbon emissions per year and contributing to prevention of deforestation of over 34-000 hectares of forest - about 34 times the size of Karura forest in Nairobi.--Kenya Biogas Programme estimates that there are more than 100-000 people in the country have installed biodigesters as biogas plants in their homes. Among the main uses are energy production and bioslurry fertiliser production. Others- like Tanui- also use the sludge as a natural pesticide against farm pests like aphids.--The technology is gaining ground faster in Kenya than in any other African country. The country's biogas sector has attracted six companies that are all successfully deploying prefabricated systems. Over 140 entrepreneurs are at work constructing fixed dome masonry-type bio digesters.--The technology's biggest challenge is affordability. Tanui- for instance- bought his digester in 2013 at Sh150-000 using a bank loan. Luckily- he was able to repay the loan within a few months from proceeds from the Boma Rhodes sale.

500,"The covid-19 pandemic has caused disruption across asset classes- and office real estate markets are ""by no means immune""- but due to their illiquid nature it could take several months or longer for data showing the true impact of the virus- a recent study by UBS Asset Management has claimed.--New occupational demand will drop away significantly this year- and a market recovery next year remains uncertain- according to the Swiss firm- which has also called on the real estate industry to focus on ""going green"" in a separate report.--Adeline Chan- research and strategy- real estate and private Markets- said: ""Real estate cannot stay business as usual. Acting to prevent and protect against global warming will become increasingly imperative in real estate investment management.""--The covid-19 pandemic could raise the urgency for greening the built environment- the study suggests.--""While the climate emergency is not directly comparable to the ongoing global health pandemic and its resulting disruption and damage- the effects of global warming will eventually have a significant impact on global supply chains- food production and ultimately- human lives. Real estate cannot stay business as usual-"" Chan added.--Although the report focused mainly on the Asia-Pacific region- its points are valid across the board- the asset manager said in a statement.--Long-term view--According to Aviva Investor's Marc Versey- chief investment officer of real assets- focusing on prime assets in core locations can help remove the risk of short-term volatility - ""that can be an advantage of real estate in difficult times"".--""We have had a movement of clients into real assets as a result of volatility before- as the relative stability it can offer in long-term cash flows comes home in periods of uncertainty.""--If the hit taken by sectors such as travel- hotels- hospitality and leisure become a long-term issue- however- this will have a knock-on effect on real estate pricing- the CIO believes.--""You may have a delay as decisions are put on hold. That is going to have a short-term impact- but the long-term impact is less clear. Our main concern in real estate is tenants we have let to being badly hit by the effects- and that's where we're really focusing-"" he says.--""Changes in capital flows - I do think- down the road- we will be able to demonstrate a defensive quality in real estate and real assets more generally- which investors are likely to seek in difficult periods. We have seen this in the past- and we have seen flows into real assets as a result.""--It's not a time for complacency - staying alert is crucial. It's a similar story across asset classes. Invesco's director of client portfolio management- Douglas Rowlands- warns that real estate owners will need to be reactive over the short-term.--This means engaging with tenants more on their day-to-day activities- ensuring assets maintain their function and cash flows- ""but the long-term fundamentals of good property- in terms of quality of location and providing the space that--When factoring in recession risk- according to Versey- which areas of the market could be affected need to be considered - ""it's quite nuanced"".--""You have to look very much at geographies and cities - what are those locations set up to do- is there a big industry around a certain city and could that industry be hit? Are these cities set up for the future?"" he asks."
513,"Scientists have warned that hurricanes will be more destructive as they slow down due to global warming--Environmental scientists warned that the increasing level of CO2 caused by global warming is causing hurricanes to move at slower speeds. According to scientists- this could cause the hurricane to become more destructive. The new study was led by a researcher from Princeton University. It was published in the journal Science Advances.--Effect of global warming on wind currents--The researchers carried out the study using meteorological data collected on hurricanes since the 1950s. Through their data- they were able to identify the direct correlation between the rising CO2 levels in the atmosphere due to increasing global temperatures and the behavior of hurricanes.--According to the researchers- the presence of higher CO2 levels in the atmosphere would push the strong mid-latitude wind currents- which are also known as the westerlies- to move further towards the Earth's poles. Based on the computer simulations carried out by the researchers- calmer wind conditions will be left behind once the westerlies move towards the poles. Unfortunately- these calmer conditions will provide hurricanes with less momentum to move forward.--Creating more destructive hurricanes--As noted by the researchers- hurricanes will be more destructive if they're moving at a slower pace since their effect on affected regions will be prolonged. One particular example of this effect is Hurricane Dorian- a Category 5 hurricane that ravaged the Bahamas last year.--Although the hurricane produced wind gusts of around 295 kilometers per hour- it moved at a very slow pace. According to the data collected by the researchers- Hurricane Dorian moved at just a handful of kilometers per hour. Its slow pace gave the hurricane enough time to destroy the areas it passed it over.--The researchers warned that by the end of the century- global temperatures could rise by 4C. This effect would lead to the formation of slower and more destructive hurricanes.--""Our simulations suggest that future anthropogenic warming could lead to a significant slowing of hurricane motion- particularly in some populated mid-latitude regions-"" climatologist Gan Zhang and lead author of the study said in a statement. ""This is the first study we are aware of that combines physical interpretation and robust modeling evidence to show that future anthropogenic warming could lead to a significant slowing of hurricane motion."""
616,"Some less than exhaustive research suggests that this book is a first: a campaign biography published by an academic press. The author is a professor of journalism at the University of Nebraska- a public institution which is also the seat of the publisher.--Charles Timothy Hagel- Republican- has served since 1997 as one of the two United States Senators from Nebraska. The purpose of the book comes clear in its final chapter- which concludes that Mr. Hagel may be ""going for the big one-"" a possible election to the Presidency in 2008. Since the book appeared- there have been reports that he will soon announce his candidacy; he had- however- not done so as of the beginning of January 2007.--One wonders whether Professor Berens and the University of Nebraska Press have set an example with this book that will be followed by others. Nebraska's other Senator- Ben Nelson- is a Democrat. So far- the catalog of the University of Nebraska Press lacks any works on him. Nor- for example- does one find any works on George W. Bush published by university presses in Texas- or by the presses of the two universities where he studied- Yale and Harvard. Perhaps- though- this reviewer is behind the times. He still fails- for example- to understand how publishers can permit authors to tamper with history under the label of ""literary nonfiction."" (One such author says she has ""taken very few liberties with the historical record."" Does that not take her work wholly out of the nonfiction category?)--Senator Hagel has- in any case- led an interesting- productive- and in many ways admirable life. Professor Berens describes with considerable frankness his childhood and youth. By the time Chuck Hagel was fifteen years old he- his parents- and his three younger brothers had lived in five Nebraska towns- as his father repeatedly changed jobs. We are told that his father had a drinking problem- but that he was not abusive. Perhaps the more important fact for Chuck Hagel's development was that the parents attended church- and the sons did- too-and that the father died at 39 when Chuck was a high-school junior- and a new burden fell on the eldest son. He seems to have lived up to his responsibilities. Berens quotes one of his brothers as saying that he did not try to function as a father- ""but as the head male in the pack."" He also worked at a variety of jobs- during and between school terms- but that was not unusual for a Midwestern boy.--The first question about Hagel's character that may rise in readers' minds-remember that we are examining a man who seeks the most challenging job in America if not the world-comes with his college years. He tried two colleges but left both. In each case- a pinched nerve prevented him from playing football- but perhaps more important was that at nineteen he was- the author says- ""unsettled."" Like many other young men- he did some drinking. But then he went to Minneapolis- and while working at odd jobs he successfully completed a one-year course at the Brown Institute of Radio and Television. Although our author does not say so- a number of graduates of the Institute (now Brown College) have had successful media careers- e.g. Tim Russell of ""A Prairie Home Companion."" Hagel came back to Nebraska in 1967 and went to work for a radio station in Lincoln- but Uncle Sam wanted him.--In 1967 American military involvement in Vietnam was deepening- and America drafted its young men. College students could obtain deferment from the draft. Berens says that Hagel's draft board ""...suggested to him that he reenroll in college if he wanted to avoid Vietnam. It was perfectly legal- but Hagel declined the offer...He told the draft board he'd like to volunteer immediately for the army. The board members were stunned.""--This account stuns. The draft board would have been derelict in its duty-which was to secure young men for military service-if it had urged a particular young man to take steps to avoid being called up. But no young man then had to be told there were student deferments. And volunteering for the draft was nothing unusual. Many men who wanted to get in- and out- of the army as fast as they could do the same thing; volunteering simply put one's name on the callup list above those who did not volunteer.--What is more important than any of the above is the fact that Chuck Hagel went to Vietnam as a private- eventually was promoted to sergeant and squad leader- fought bravely- and returned home after a year with several decorations- including two Purple Hearts for battle wounds. (His brother Tom- who served with him- came home with three Purple Hearts.)--By this point- it seems- Hagel had cast off what might be called his youthful lassitude. He graduated from the University of Nebraska at Omaha- found what at first was a temporary job with a Nebraska Congressman in Washington- and began- as Berens says- to climb Capitol Hill-and not just Capitol Hill. He went to work for Firestone Tire's Washington office and became the company's chief lobbyist. He went to work for Ronald Reagan's Presidential campaign and was rewarded after Reagan's 1980 victory by being made the deputy administrator of the then Veterans Administration. Next- he went into the cellular telephone business and made millions. For a time he headed the United Service Organization. From what Berens tells us- he did an excellent job of restructuring the USO- an organization that had been helping American military personnel since World War II and badly needed streamlining. In the mid-1990s- Hagel returned to Omaha and joined an investment banking firm- the McCarthy Group- in which he continues to have a sizable interest today. In 1996- Hagel ran for the Senate and won- and was reelected in 2002 for a new six-year term which will end in January 2009- the month when a new President is to take office.--Berens' account of Hagel's Senate years is no more critical than what she writes about his earlier life. On the environment- for example- we read without comment by the author or others that Hagel-a leader in Senate opposition to the Kyoto Protocol-now acknowledges that global warming is an important question- or at least ""a big deal to our allies."" A balanced portrait of Mr. Hagel might have made clear that overall he scores low on environmental protection. The latest scorecard of the League of Conservation Voters gives Hagel just 14%. (This League is not a leftwing group; its board includes- for example- Theodore Roosevelt IV- a Republican and managing director of Lehman Brothers.) Hagel's Republican rival- Senator John McCain of Arizona- scores 29%. Of his Democratic rivals in the Senate- Hilary Clinton of New York gets 71%- and Barack Obama of Illinois 100%. And while Hagel might prefer that America not focus on global warming- Iowa's Democratic governor- Tom Vilsack- is putting the problem at the forefront of his campaign for the Presidency.--Chuck Hagel- says our author- has had a lifelong fascination with foreign affairs. He pushed successfully to join the Foreign Relations Committee when he joined the Senate. He has been deeply concerned with the problems the United States faces in Iraq and the Middle East- warning in late November 2006 of ""impending disaster"" in Iraq. Since the release of the report of the Baker-Hamilton Commission on December 6- 2006- Hagel has emphasized- in general agreement with Baker and Hamilton- the need for the U.S. to pursue an Iraq settlement not just with the parties in Iraq but with Iraq's neighbors and the international community. All this puts Senator Hagel at some odds with President Bush. The main question- although our author does not mention it- is to what extent Senator Hagel should- or can- as a Republican candidate distance himself from the Republican now in the White House."
676,With the economy going into a shutdown mode for at least month- and possibly quite a bit longer- we're again hearing the cries from elite economics columnists about a Second Great Depression. These are pernicious- not only because they are wrongheaded- but they can be used to justify bad things- like giving hundreds of billions of dollars to the bankers who wrecked the economy with their recklessness during the housing bubble.--The basic and simple error made by the Second Great Depression gang is that they imagine we can be condemned to a prolonged period of high unemployment and slow growth by a single bad event. Their story is that letting the banks fail caused the first Great Depression and that we would have had round two if we let the market work its magic in 2008-09 on Goldman Sachs- Citigroup- and the rest. The uncontrolled bank failures were indeed very bad news for the economy at the start of the Great Depression- and a wave of major bank failures in 2008-09 would undoubtedly have made the initial slump worse in the Great Recession- but neither necessitated a prolonged slump.--What got us out of the Great Depression was the massive spending associated with World War II. There was no economic reason we could not have had this spending in 1931 rather than 1941- except have it focused on building roads- schools- hospitals and other socially useful projects. We didn't have massive spending in 1931- or 1932- or even during the New Deal- for political reasons- not economic ones.--So let's stop the game-playing. We need good policy right now to keep people whole through a shutdown period and then to get people back to work when we reopen. Ideally we will also be addressing long neglected needs- like universal health care- child care- and slowing global warming- but this Second Great Depression stuff is just silly.
732,"At the beginning of this year- the Australian bushfire that burned for more than four months was finally extinguished. Nearly 6 million hectares of woodland were burned- and nearly 500 million animals were buried in flames. In front of nature- human beings are vulnerable. Fortunately- however- after the blazing fire- Australia's burnt plants began to grow again.--For millions of years- humans seem to have been looking for a way to live in harmony with the earth. Destruction- governance- protection -- can we only meet the creatures on earth in this way?--This pandemic has undoubtedly brought pain and bruising for human beings. Every unprepared farewell is a long and painful affair for the individual involved in it. However- for nature- some good things are happening in light of these dark times.--On the streets of Adelaide- Australia- there is a kangaroo jumping freely on the streets of the city center. In Italy- a jellyfish was found in a canal in Venice. Due to the reduction in the flow of ships- the water became clearer and more transparent- and it was easier to observe marine life even in the city center. Llandudno- a small town in North Wales- England- adopted blockade measures and the empty streets were occupied by flocks of wild goats. And wild coyotes hang out on the San Francisco beach.--The World Meteorological Organization said that due to the pandemic- global carbon dioxide emissions fell by 6% this year- but this is not enough to suppress global warming.--In 2018- Eastern cougars were officially declared extinct. In 2019- the last Achatinella Apexfulva died. In 2020- the Yangtze fauna declared extinction. The reality is cruel. Those species that had escaped countless changes over millions of years have become extinct because of human activities. And these things are happening around us.--Although COVID-19 does improve our living environment in the short term- when the pandemic ends and human life returns to normal- we will use some chemical fuels and emit car exhaust- causing air pollution. It is important to realize the effect the day-to-day life we once took for granted impacts the environment.--As Bruce Vaughn- the climatologist of the University of Colorado Boulder- said: ""It's a great time to take stock of how our daily lives and our actions really do impact the environment we live in. We're all in this together. We all share the same nest. And I think that's one thing this pandemic may be showing us is that our actions do impact one another."""
888,"Two years after Donald Trump won the presidency- the author of ""How Fascism Works"" assessed him in a video. ""It might seem like an exaggeration to call Trump a fascist-"" Yale professor Jason Stanley said. ""I mean- he's not calling for a genocide or imprisoning his own people without due process. But . . . if you use history and philosophy as a guide- it's easy to see parallels between Trump's words and those of the most reviled fascists in history. That scares me- and it should scare you too.""--Drawing on his decade of studying fascist propaganda- Stanley concluded: ""If you're not worried about encroaching fascism in America- before long it will start to feel normal. And when that happens- we're all in trouble.""--We're all in trouble.--Trumpism has started to feel normal. Trump stands a good chance of winning re-election in November. And his odds have improved because the Democratic Party is expected to nominate an abysmal candidate.--For ample good reasons- many progressives disdain Joe Biden. He has a long record as a corporate servant- ally of racial injustice and avid supporter of the military-industrial complex. Now- in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic- he scarcely seems able to articulate anything worthwhile.--In short- as the two contenders with a chance to win the presidential race- Biden and Trump are offering a choice between neo-liberalism and neo-fascism.--To hear a small but significant portion of the U.S. left tell it these days- that's not a meaningful choice. Some say preventing the re-election of Trump isn't important. That amounts to ignore ing political reality- an evasion with potentially vast consequences.--""We should make no mistake-"" longtime progressive journalist Juan González said days ago- ""that this country is edging closer and closer to neo-fascist authoritarianism.""--That reality doesn't stop some on the left from evading it -- preferring to conflate the two major parties to a degree akin to denial.--Earlier this month- I listened to a discussion that included an eminent left author who flatly declared that on ""all major issues"" there is ""no real difference between the Democratic and Republican parties."" A preposterous claim.--Soon afterward- I read an article by an editor at a high-quality left magazine that displayed odd complacency about whether or not Trump gets a second term: ""The most likely outcome if he wins re-election is not a crude dictatorship- but further erosion of civil liberties within the existing political framework. Opposition parties and media will still be able to function. The people who suffer the worst forms of oppression under Trump will be the immigrants and ethnic minorities whose rights are routinely violated under Republican and Democratic presidencies alike.""--Really? It won't matter to ""immigrants and ethnic minorities"" whether Trump is president for another four years?--When there's a genuine threat of sliding into fascism- the left has an overarching responsibility to fight against the momentum of the extreme right. Sometimes that requires a broad coalition.--The left in France was correct when- in 2017- it united with a corporate centrist to defeat neo-fascist National Front candidate Marine Le Pen in the runoff election for president. In 2020- for the United States- the dangers are no less grave.--It's true that leading ""moderate"" Democrats and even some self-described ""progressives"" have routinely functioned as enablers for the rightward tilt of national politics -- a bad dynamic that has continued on Capitol Hill in the midst of the pandemic under leadership from Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. Not wanting to seem obstructionist often ends up being helpful to right-wing agendas.--But here's a key point: People who deny or downplay the real threat of neo-fascism consolidating itself via Trump's re-election are- in effect- serving as enablers for the forces of the virulent extreme right that already controls so much of the U.S. government.--""It's important to remember that right now- the issue of greatest urgency is to get rid of the malignancy in the White House-"" Noam Chomsky said in an interview last week. ""If we don't do that- everything else pales into insignificance. To keep this for another four years means racing to the abyss on global warming- possibly reaching irreversible tipping points- sharply increasing the threat of nuclear war- stuffing the judiciary with young- ultra-right- mostly unqualified lawyers who will guarantee that anything to the left of Attila the Hun can't survive for a generation- and on and on. This is top priority.""--In that video interview with The Intercept- Chomsky added: ""There's a thing called arithmetic. You can debate a lot of things- but not arithmetic. Failure to vote for Biden in this election in a swing state amounts to voting for Trump. Takes one vote away from the opposition- same as adding one vote to Trump. So- if you decide you want to vote for the destruction of organized human life on Earth. . . then do it openly. . . . But that's the meaning of 'Never Biden.'""--In ""How Fascism Works-"" Professor Stanley addressed ""fascist politics"" -- and repeatedly used that term when describing the Trump-led Republican Party.--For those in the USA who recoil at applying such a phrase to today- preferring to call it hyperbole- Stanley's book sheds clear light on an insidious process that normalizes and obscures: ""Normalization of fascist ideology- by definition- would make charges of 'fascism' seem like an overreaction- even in societies whose norms are transforming along these worrisome lines. Normalization means precisely that encroaching ideologically extreme conditions are not recognized as such because they have come to seem normal. The charge of fascism will always seem extreme; normalization means that the goalposts for the legitimate use of 'extreme' terminology continually move.""--Meanwhile- Stanley wrote- ""Fascist politics exchanges reality for the pronouncements of a single individual- or perhaps a political party. Regular and repeated obvious lying is part of the process by which fascist politics destroys the information space. A fascist leader can replace truth with power- ultimately lying without consequence. By replacing the world with a person- fascist politics makes us unable to assess arguments by a common standard. The fascist politician possesses specific techniques to destroy information spaces and break down reality."""
956,"The student group Fridays for Future- whose Greta Thunberg -inspired street protests have in the past drawn huge crowds worldwide- says it will use online streaming and videos on social media to demand more action from leaders to curb global warming.--Thunberg said Wednesday during an online event for Earth Day that the climate crisis ""may not be as immediate as the corona crisis but we need to tackle this now otherwise it will be irreversible."" Some groups have found creative ways to stage very limited demonstrations despite the lockdown. In Berlin- activists have collected thousands of banners and protest placards that will be placed at key sites around the German capital's government district Friday.--Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets for the last global climate protest in November.--Follow AP coverage of the pandemic at http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak"
